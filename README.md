## http redirects

your website should serve over https consistently - if the url is:

```
mysite.com/about
```

then the browser should hit:

```
https://www.mysite.com/about
```

the 'www' and the 'https://' have to be inserted by HTTP 302 redirect

TODO - write about how google needs to be setup to find these pages
